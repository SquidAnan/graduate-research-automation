# graduate-research-automation
 
This system automates the process of participant recruitment of my graduate research. The main purpose was to practice building a system that integrates frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend (Node.js), and a database (MySQL).

To make this project more interesting, the system was designed to be extremely offensive. Don't take it too seriously.
